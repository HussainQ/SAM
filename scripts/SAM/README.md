K-Medians is a clustering algorithm that is similar to KMeans
but uses the median instead of the mean to calculate
cluster centers. We are using the SAM program to analyze a
dataset and group similar data points into clusters. Our goal
is to evaluate the performance of the K-Medians algorithm
on this dataset and compare it to other clustering algorithms.

This folder contains independent files with the code implementation in "K-Medians_with_Anomalies.ipynb", 
with the hope that this will be integrated directly into SAM one day.

Use the CTU Scenario training data to test the implementation.

TODO: Add a loop to read in all 13 CTU Features, and increase sample size.
